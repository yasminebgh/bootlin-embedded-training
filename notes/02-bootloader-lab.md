Objectives: Set up serial communication, understand the AM62x Bootprocess,
compile and install the U-Boot bootloader, use basic U-Boot commands, set
up TFTP communication with the development workstation.

To begin with:
    The bootloader is a small program that starts the device and loads the OS (The starter engine of the system)
    -> Initializes the hardware(CPU, RAM, Storage...)
    -> Loads the OS kernel from the storage into RAM
    -> Starts the kernel so the OS can take over
